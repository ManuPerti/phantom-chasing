# Phantom Chasing
## Description
Simple 2D game developed in Java language using Lightweight Java Game Library.

## Development
I created this game during my studies on Multiplatform Application, so it's very simple. Nevertheless you can notice some features such as:
- Music and SFX reproduction
- Event-driven and OOP programming.
- Map created using tilesets and layers (Tiled).

## Execute instrucions
Download the project and execute **PMDM02.jar** inside *dist* directory.

## Game instructions
Your goal is to pick up 4 objects (armor, weapon, helmet and shield) dispersed around the map avoiding ghosts, obstacles and holes.

Use the arrows to move the character in all directions and be careful, because each time you pick and object, a new ghost will appear and speed will increase.
